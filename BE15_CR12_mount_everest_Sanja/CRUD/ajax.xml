        <name>Paris</name>
        <description>Paris is a city unlike any other. It is overflowing with culture, history, and beauty. And while people travel to Paris to see the Louvre, climb the Eiffel Tower, or see Notre-Dame, the real magic is found in the streets. Here, the ins and outs of daily life play out - chic women on bikes pedal their children to school, artists post up in cafes with a notebook, and both young and old line up morning and evening for a fresh baguette from the neighborhood boulangerie</description>

        <name>Budapest</name>
        <description>The modern-day Budapest results from the amalgamation of two historic cities lying right opposite each other over the Danube river. Buda is the western (left) bank side, with the high hill atop which the Buda castle sits. Pest is the relatively flat eastern (right) bank side, with the Parliament, numerous other stately buildings, and busy streets retaining all their 19th century architectural heritage.</description>

        <name>Belgrade</name>
        <description>Though it may come as a surprise to some, Belgrade has a plethora of places to visit. The Belgrade Fortress, one of the most important historical monuments in Serbia, sits on the best location in town: overlooking the confluence of both rivers. Everyone in Belgrade comes to walk around the fortress and Kalemegdan Park. The entire city was inside the fortress for centuries. Thus, the fortress's history reflects that of Belgrade. The Celts founded the fortress in the 3rd century BC. It was later Roman, Byzantine, Bulgarian, Serbian, Hungarian, Turkish, and Austrian. As you can see, everybody who was somebody wanted Belgrade!</description>

        <description>London's iconic skyline is an eclectic combination of instantly recognisable landmarks, from the historic Tower of London to the ultra-modern skyscrapers of The Shard and 20 Fenchurch. A walk through the Square Mile immerses you in the original Roman settlement, with parts of the ancient defensive wall still visible. You'll also find some of the London's cosiest pubs around there, such as Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, a former haunt of Charles Dickens and Mark Twain. For lovers of the arts, look no further than the world-class theatres of London's West End and the live music venues of Camden, Soho and Shoreditch. You'll also find endless galleries and museums dotted around, such as the free-to-visit British Museum, Natural History Museum and the National Gallery.</description>
